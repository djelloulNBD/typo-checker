Instructions:

For Text Input:

Example Output for Text:
Input: "The cheif met with his teem to discus the new stratgy."

Output:

typos --> corrected
cheif --> chief
teem --> team
discus --> discuss
stratgy --> strategy

context --> suggestion

"The chief met with his team to discuss the new strategy." --> The sentence is now grammatically correct and clear. However, consider adding more detail about the strategy to improve context: "The chief met with his team to discuss the new marketing strategy."
Example Output for Image:
Input: An image of a restaurant menu with the text: "Welcmoe to our restauarnt! Try our specail pasta dish!"

Output:

typos (in image text) --> corrected
Welcmoe --> Welcome
restauarnt --> restaurant
specail --> special

context (visual/textual) --> suggestion

The menu text contains multiple typos that could harm the restaurant's credibility. --> Correct the typos and consider revising the phrasing for better impact: "Welcome to our restaurant! Try our signature pasta dish today!"
Additionally, the font size appears small and may be hard to read. --> Increase the font size and use a bold, clean typeface for better visibility. Consider adding a background color to make the text stand out.
